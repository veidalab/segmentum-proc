   Implementation by Walter Bell (wbell@cs.cornell.edu) 2001.

   This code implements the algorithm for finding the min-cut/max-flow
   on a graph as described in the paper. It is memory and efficiency
   optimized for vision applications in which neighbor nodes have
   connections to each other and nodes have connections to both the
   source and the sink. It will work on arbitrary graphs however, but
   the memory allocation pattern will not be as ideal as for vision
   applications. This code implements a few additional optimizations
   not described in the paper such as not finding a parent for an
   orphaned sink node during the adoption phase, and these are
   documented in the code.

  /* Implementation notes: much of the design of this implementation
     was to minimize the amount of memory used on large graphs, as
     when image sizes hit 1M pixels, graph centric algorithms tend to
     use incredible amounts of space. Hence, we attempt to store
     things compactly without paying a large runtime overhead.

     The sets S, and A are represented by bit vectors, and an
     additional Alist is a list of active nodes in A that should be
     inspected.

     All edges are assumed to be bidirectional, which saves on memory
     as they only need to be created and maintained once. This also
     makes the augmentation phase very efficient.

     Edges from the terminals to the nodes are represented in the
     nodes themselves in a much more compact form. This saves a great
     deal of space since all terminal edges can only be
     unidirectional. This adds some complexity to the code, but turns
     out to provide a decent memory savings as well as much greater
     efficiency.

     Because grow() and adopt() work on variable lists (A and O
     respectively) which need to grow, we allocate links for the Alist
     and Olist in blocks to better pack memory, which leads to lower
     construction overhead as well as better caching performance
     because of the locality of the links.
